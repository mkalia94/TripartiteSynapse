Running the simulations from the manuscript 'Ion dynamics of the energy-deprived tripartite synapse'
- Manu Kalia, 10-Feb-2020

1. Requirements
 a) Install Python 3.x (anaconda recommended)
 b) In a new environment install the following packages:
  - warnings
  - numpy
  - assimulo
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - json
  - os
  - autograd 
  - argparse

2. Refer to files 'Example' and Paper_Figures on how to run simulations

3. Bifurcation computations are stored in various .mat files in the folder 'BifFiles'.
   Running 'createbif.py' constructs the bifurcation diagram presented in Fig. 5 automatically.

4. For any further questions, please contact m.kalia@utwente.nl
